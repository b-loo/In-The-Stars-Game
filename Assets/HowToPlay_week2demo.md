"In The Stars" Stage 2 Demo Instructions
For the stage 2 demo game, we have made a demo of our mechanic of drawing in the player's notebook. The player will only draw on the right page of the notebook.

Using the mouse, the player should click and drag on the canvas to create a bright blue line. Our demo only recognizes a basic trangle so far, so we could test our mechanic. In this demo, the goal is to draw a basic right triangle described in the directions below.

How to play:
When you open the executable file, a blank notebook should appear with a grid of "+" on the page to guide the drawings.
In order to draw the shape our algorithm recognizes, draw a right triangle on connecting the following "+" in (row, column) of the grid: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4, 3) and back to (3,2).
After drawing the triangle described in step 3, the console log should show if you have hit the correct collision boxes and made the correct shape. The console log should show a message that says "You did it!" if you successfully made the triangle.
If you have created the incorrect shape or want to start over, you can click the clear button on the top right and that will delete any drawings made on the screen.
